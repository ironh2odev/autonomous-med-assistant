# 🧠 Autonomous AI Medical Diagnosis & Treatment Recommender

**Summary:**
A full-stack AI-powered application capable of analyzing chest X-ray images, predicting possible diagnoses, and providing LLM-generated medical explanations. Built to simulate real-world medical assistant tools and demonstrate expertise in end-to-end autonomous AI product development.

**Key Features:**

**📸 Computer Vision Model** (ViT dummy backbone) for chest X-ray anomaly detection and diagnosis prediction.

**🤖 LLM Integration** for generating natural language explanations of the AI's predictions.

**🖥️ Streamlit Frontend** enabling X-ray uploads, prediction visualization, and historical diagnosis tracking.

**☁️ Cloud Deployment** via Dockerized infrastructure on Railway, making the app publicly accessible.

**📂 Modular Architecture** supporting future expansion (drug interaction prediction, RL-based treatment planning).

**🔒 Environment Configuration & Infrastructure using** .env, requirements.txt, Dockerfile for production readiness.

**Technologies Used:**

Python • Streamlit • Docker • Railway (Cloud Deployment)

Vision Transformers (ViT) • OpenAI GPT-4 API (for explanation)

**Future Enhancements Planned:**

🧠 GNN-based Drug Interaction Prediction

🩺 RL-based Personalized Treatment Planning
